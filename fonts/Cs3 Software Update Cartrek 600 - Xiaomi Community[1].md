Why should you update your software to CS3? CS3 is the latest and most advanced navigation software from CarTrek. It has many features that make your driving easier and safer. For example, CS3 has better graphics that show you more details on the map, such as buildings, landmarks, and traffic signs. CS3 also has a new and faster routing algorithm that calculates the best route for you based on your preferences, traffic conditions, and road restrictions. You can also choose from different keyboards (qwerty, azerty, abc) to enter your destination or search for points of interest. Speaking of points of interest, CS3 has more information on them, such as phone numbers, opening hours, and ratings. You can also add your own points of interest to the map, such as your favorite restaurants, shops, or parks. Finally, if you like boating, you can expand your software with water maps of the Netherlands, which show you the waterways, bridges, locks, and marinas.
 
How to update your software to CS3? Updating your software to CS3 is free and easy. You can do it in two ways: by downloading the software on your computer and transferring it to your SD-card, or by sending your SD-card to CarTrek and letting them do it for you. Both methods are explained in detail here. The download method is faster and more convenient, but you need a computer and an SD-card-reader. The mail method is simpler but takes longer, as you have to wait for your SD-card to be returned. Whichever method you choose, make sure you back up your data before updating your software. You don't want to lose your saved routes, favorites, or settings.
 
What are the benefits of updating your software to CS3? Updating your software to CS3 will give you a better navigation experience with CarTrek 600. You will enjoy more features, more information, and more options. You will also get the latest map updates and bug fixes.
